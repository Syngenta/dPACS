# dPACS.pl


This perl script is intended as a design tool for use with the dPACS method [insert literature reference here - TBC]

### Installation

Installation assumes a basic knowledge of perl and the EMBOSS package.

In addition to this script, you will need to install and correctly configure the EMBOSS package (<http://emboss.open-bio.org/>)  along with the REBASE database (<http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html>) which should be configured using the EMBOSS rebaseextract program.
In addition, the dPACS script should be edited (near the top) to include the location of a REBASE proto format file, which should be the same version as is imported into EMBOSS, though it can be a separate copy.

You'll need the Docopt, List::Util and IPC::Open2 perl modules installed. 

The script also requires access to temp space (e.g./tmp) if you need to change this, it's at the top of the script ($TMPDIR and also the command to create the subdirectory, below it.).

### Usage

The script accepts various command line parameters:
..* -wildseq and - -mutseq are the two oligonucleotide sequences, as strings.
..* -mutations is the number of mutations allowed to create the restriction site
..* -scan (left|right|straddle|all) controls whether just mutations to the left, right, straddling (where - -mutations > 2) or all, are reported.
..* -cut (all|wild|mut) outputs suggestions which cut either, just the wildtype or just the mutant sequence.
..* -zero includes - -mutations=0, in order to indicate confounding cut sites.
..* -revcomp reverse complements all sequences.

-h --help --perldoc give help

The script can be run at the command line, easily incorporated into a galaxy (https://usegalaxy.org/) installation, or could pretty easily be modified to run as a web cgi.
